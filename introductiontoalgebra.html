                    <p>Algebra in simple terms is solving the expression or equation with simple methods of elimination to figure out the number, some easy one's can be done in your head or quickly worked out on a piece of paper, but other's will take some time and some methods to get to the answer, also during these methods always remember that the BODMAS or BIDMAS method will always be applicable to your calculations and working out, just incase for a recap they stand for in order of priority:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Brackets</li>
                        <li>Power Of/Indicies</li>
                        <li>Division</li>
                        <li>Multiplication</li>
                        <li>Addition</li>
                        <li>Subtraction</li>
                    </ul>
                    
                    <p>For simple equations the answers often just take some simple mathematics, for example if we had the equation "4x + 2 = 10" after some methods of elimination we could work out that the answer is "x = 2". These questions can get infinitly harder in terms of variables as there could be multiple variables within a single equation or two equations which are linked together so the variables that co-incide with each other if there were two "x" variables would be the same and would have to work them out in unison, but for now we will start at the basics.</p>
                    
                    <p>The exercises provided use Google Form's so your teacher and only your teacher can monitor individual progress through the exercises to see who is doing fine and who needs some clarification or some help to grasp this subject. Each exercise will get progressivly harder so please feel free to jot down notes and even use paper/calculator to help you work out the equations and don't forget to keep the working out on your paper as it could help you in the future and will gain you marks in your SAT's.</p>
